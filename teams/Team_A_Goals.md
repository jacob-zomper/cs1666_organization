## Game Description

For our project, we are building a 2D flight game where the goal is
 to safely fly through enemy territory and reach your safe base. 
 The player will be challenged by caves with obstacles, bullets 
 and missiles flying towards them, and AI controlled enemy planes.
 The games should be completed in around 3 minutes reasonably.


## Specific Milestones

* Creating a randomly generated map that cycles between a cave 
	like obstacle based challenge, and an open-air dog fighting challenge.
* Will have different types of rockets that each chase the plane with varying speeds and nimbleness. 
* The open air will have a cieling with a stall-out effect to add an upper border to the world.
* Missiles can be dodged and collide with each other to stay safe.
* Difficulty can be scaled to 3 different levels for adaptive challenges. 


## Advanced topics

* Physics
	* Simulated accurate ricochet of bullets in the cave.
	* adding destuctable environment such as stalagmites 
	* Accurately create a 2d flight simulation for the player.
	* Include effects that incoming rockets, bullets, and planes will have on the player.
	
* Random level generation
	* Create a mapping system that allows for switching between cave and open air
	* Cave system will be randomly generated with obstacles (stalagmites/stalactites).
	* Randomness of AA guns on the ground and rockets/planes that are shot at the player

* AI
	* Create adaptive rockets that can chase the player
	* Planes may either have the goal of shooting the player down
		from behind or colliding with them midair.
	* Add AI ability to dodge incoming bullet fire from player.
